# Welcome to the Patriot App – the military connector

Helping others in our military community

# Overview

This app was created for friends and families of deployed military members. If you don’t live in military housing on a military installment, and your loved one is deployed overseas life can be harder than it is normally. This app creates a community for anyone connected with a deployed military member who needs anything from help moving, borrowing tools, or even carpooling. It also provides an avenue for anyone who is offering free help such as; baby-sitting, or lawn service.
